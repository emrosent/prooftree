###### A visual way to easily produce LaTeX for everyone's favorite kind of tree ðŸŒ³ 

I made this tool for use in CMU's 15-317 Constructive Logic, but it's useful for anyone
who wants to LaTeX a proof tree :)


This code is the latex-only portion of the full tool I built. The source code for
the full tool (that generates CLogic-specific SML for auto-verifiable proofs)
is private for academic integrity purposes, but you can find the website
[here](https://proof-tree-generator.web.app). 
###### _Note that you need to sign in with a CMU email address to access the full tool._
